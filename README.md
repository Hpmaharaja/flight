# flightHelp
A web application that analyzes flight delays across the world to help potential buyers minimize delayed travel time!

## Description
flightHelp is an application designed to help travelers obtain a better understanding of flight delays, and assist them in selecting the right airline with minimal delay times. For example, if a flyer wants to fly from Los Angeles to New York, he/she would enter those two cities on the web application, and once the processing is finished, the front-end responds with top airlines flying in the next 24 hours between the specified locations with the minimal delay times.
